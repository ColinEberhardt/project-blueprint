  | Token                       | Replace with                                                      |
  | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `{project name}`            | The name of the GitHub repository the project resides in.         |
  | `{yyyy}`                    | The year you started working on the code.                         |
  | `{name of copyright owner}` | The copyright owner of the code (typically you or your employer). |
